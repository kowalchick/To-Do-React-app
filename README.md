# Hi people!

Link to demo of this site is [here](https://todo-app-kowalchick.netlify.app/)

## Short Description of my work

This app is a task I was about to do on workshop3 on bootcamp JavaScript Developer after finishing the React module.

All guidelines of this project I received from my school.  
To compile all files I used webpack this time.

Preparing this app I polished my skills related to React such as: creating components, communicating with the API, managing CSS classes in JSX and passing props to the components.
Additionally, I practiced writing async/await syntax to work with promises. This JavaScript feature was added in ECMAScript2017 and my lectures has not cover this syntax yet.

More advanced apps are coming soon.

Enjoy!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

###JSON server
I have changed the sever. Run it with a command: `npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json`
